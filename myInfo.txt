When building multiple microservices - e.g. with Spring Boot - the integration and delivery pipelines of your services will most likely be very similar. 
Surely, you don’t want to copy-and-paste Pipeline code from one Jenkinsfile to another if you develop a new service 
or if there are adaptions in your delivery process. Instead you would like to define something like a pipeline "template" 
that can be applied easily to all of your services.

The requirement for a common pipeline that can be used in multiple projects does not only emerge in microservice architectures.
It’s valid for all areas where applications are built on a similar technology stack or deployed in a standardized way (e.g. pre-packages as containers).
The most important part here is also mentioned in the official doc: such libraries are considered ‘trusted’
people with push permissions to the repository containing the Global Library have basically unlimited access to Jenkins
If you’ve ever worked with Jenkins shared libraries, you know that they’re a great way to simplify your Jenkins Pipeline DSL scripts by abstracting out common code to a function. For example, this:
Finding candidates for a library
When thinking about moving parts of your pipeline to a library, imagine creating a similar script in the next project or creating an additional pipeline 
that reuses bits of the one you already have. What can/should be extracted to make that possible or painless? Keep in mind that 
when scaling your delivery pipelines you probably want to introduce a change in a few places as possible.

Do NOT use Jenkins plugins in the pipline, use docker images with build capabilities instead (decoupling build capablities from Jenkins)
ex) DO NOT  
       def dockerTool = tool name: 'docker', type: 'org.jenkinsci.plugins.docker.commons.tools.DockerTool'  withEnv(["DOCKER=${dockerTool}/bin"]) {
	DO 
    docker.image('emtrout/nind23').inside("--privileged"){
	      sh "${BUILD_COMMAND}"
	   


Qs
------------------------------------
funkar ${env.BUILD_URL}  i docker ?

Skapa eget shared-lib proj repo i github, flytta in goodies

maven release ? använda denna i rel flödet ???

  Finns en del                          <----------------------------------------- kolla verkar vara frikopplade från jenkins ..
  
https://github.com/abnamrocoesd/jenkins-pipeline-library/tree/master/docs/javaPipeline
abnamrocoesd/jenkins-pipeline-library  <---------------- kolla javapipleline flödet... även om den använder plugins
	Executes the Standard Java Pipeline.	använder jenkns plugins ex 		hudson.plugins.git.GitTool						 
            förutsetter att maven är installerad etc
			java pipeline fungerar inte , men kolla på flödet...
